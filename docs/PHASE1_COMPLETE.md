## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Tailwind CSS Linting Warnings**
   - The `@tailwind` directives show warnings in VS Code
   - These are harmless - code compiles and runs perfectly
   - Will be resolved when VS Code updates its CSS linter

2. **Authentication API**
   - Currently using <http://localhost:3001/api>
   - Make sure backend is running before testing
