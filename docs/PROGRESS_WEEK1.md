## üéØ Success Criteria for Phase 1

- [ ] Users can register with email/password
- [ ] Users can log in and receive JWT token
- [ ] Users can reset forgotten passwords
- [ ] Users can verify their email
- [ ] Users can update their profile
- [ ] Sessions are properly managed
- [ ] All auth endpoints are secure
- [ ] Frontend authentication flow is complete
- [ ] Protected routes are implemented
- [ ] User data is properly encrypted

## üöß Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
- None

### Potential Risks
1. **JWT Secret Management**: Need to implement proper secret rotation
2. **Email Service**: Need to set up email provider (SendGrid/AWS SES)
3. **Password Security**: Consider adding 2FA in future
4. **Session Management**: Need to implement session cleanup job

### Mitigation
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Start with console logging for email (dev)
- Document 2FA for Phase 4
- Implement cron job for session cleanup

## üìù Technical Decisions

### Authentication Strategy
- **Decision**: JWT with refresh tokens
- **Rationale**: Stateless, scalable, standard approach
- **Alternatives Considered**: Session-based auth (rejected - not scalable)

### Password Hashing
- **Decision**: bcrypt with 10 salt rounds
- **Rationale**: Industry standard, secure, proven
- **Alternatives Considered**: argon2 (overkill for POC)

### Database
- **Decision**: Keep SQLite for now, plan PostgreSQL migration
- **Rationale**: SQLite sufficient for POC, easier development
- **Timeline**: Migrate to PostgreSQL in Week 3

---

## üí° Lessons Learned

1. **Schema First**: Starting with complete schema design helps identify relationships early
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript + Prisma catch errors before runtime
3. **Modular Services**: Separate auth logic makes testing easier
4. **Documentation**: Clear implementation plan saves time
