# Contributing to ParentFlow

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ParentFlow! This document provides guidelines for contributing to our Hebrew language parent communication system.

## üë• Project Team

- **[Ron Lederer](https://github.com/ronsway)** - Lead Developer
- **Dana Tchetchik** - Product Manager

## üéØ Project Overview

ParentFlow is designed to help Israeli parents manage school communications more efficiently by using Hebrew Natural Language Processing to extract actionable tasks and events from parent group messages.

## Principles

Empathy first; clarity over cleverness; small commits; document everything; privacy by design.

## Workflow

- **Repository**: <https://github.com/ronsway/MakeMyDay.git>
- Branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feat/<name>`
- Issue-first development; PRs reference PRD or an Issue
- Run lint/tests before pushing

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ronsway/MakeMyDay.git
   cd MakeMyDay
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up development environment**

   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   npm start
   ```

## Standards

- **Languages**: TypeScript (web/backend), Hebrew NLP processing
- **Tools**: ESLint + Prettier; Vitest/Jest testing
- **Commits**: Conventional Commits format
- **RTL Support**: All UI components must support Hebrew right-to-left layout

### Hebrew/RTL Guidelines

- Ensure RTL compatibility for new UI components
- Use Hebrew-compatible fonts (Assistant, Open Sans Hebrew)
- Test with real Hebrew parent communication examples
- Maintain semantic meaning in Hebrew text processing

## Testing

- Unit + integration tests required
- Hebrew NLP test fixtures in `/tests/fixtures/`
- Test API endpoints with Hebrew data
- Version compatibility testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run Hebrew NLP tests specifically
npm run test:nlp

# Test API endpoints
npm run test:api

# Check version compatibility
npm run version:check
```
